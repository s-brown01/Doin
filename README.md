## Project Description
Our goal when creating this site was to help users connect with friends and go on 
outdoor activities together. It allows users to create, join, and post photos to past events. 

Doin is a social media platform designed for event sharing and social interaction.
Users can create events, join friends, and share experiences in real-time,
fostering community engagement and collaboration.

Our program was created using Java 21, Gradle, Angular, JPA, JWT, SLF4J, Logback, and MySQL.


## Challenges

While building this site, we faced a few challenges, some of which required significant troubleshooting. The four biggest issues were:

1. Tests
   - Initially, our **H2 database** was not configuring correctly, causing errors when inserting data into entities.
   - To resolve this, we created a new service specifically for handling security questions. This solution required 
     extensive trial-and-error and in-depth research, but ultimately allowed us to resolve the issue.
2. Learning Angular
   - Understanding **Angular** for frontend development posed a learning curve. While not a major blocker, it took time
     to master its features and tools.
   - Resources like the [official Angular tutorials](https://angular.dev/tutorials) were instrumental in helping us
     efficiently learn and implement Angular's core functionalities.
3. Storing Images
   - Managing image storage and retrieval proved challenging due to the large data size of image files.
   - Relational databases are not ideal for handling binary data. We explored alternative solutions, including external
     storage services, but opted to keep image data within the database for simplicity in this version of the application.
4. JWT Tokens
   1. Finding the Correct Version
      - Researching and implementing the correct version of **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication required
        significant effort.
      - After comparing multiple libraries and approaches, we selected **Auth0**'s implementation for its robust 
        documentation and compatibility. Learn more about their JWTs on
        <a href = "https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens"> Auth0's site</a>.
   2. Invalidating Tokens
      - One issue we encountered was token invalidation. When a user logs out, the token is removed from session 
        storage, requiring re-authentication upon re-login. However, if a user manually copies their token and 
        inserts it into cookies, the token remains valid until it expires.
      - A potential solution is to store all valid tokens in a database. However, this approach would make the 
        application **stateful** instead of **stateless**, as it requires maintaining prior information.
      - Since maintaining a stateless architecture was a priority and resolving this was beyond the scope of the
        project, we opted not to address it in this iteration.

## Future Features

We were able to implement almost every feature we wanted, but there are a few more we would have added if we
had more time. Those features are...

1. **Stories**
    - This is the only feature from our original design we were unable to implement.
    - We were hoping for a way to share photos of events and friends to a story bar (similar to
      **Instagram** and **Snapchat**).
    - Because of time restrictions, we had to scrap this idea.
    - Adding this feature in the future could significantly enhance user engagement by promoting event sharing
      and fostering a sense of community.
2. **Messaging**
    - One feature that could improve our site is a way to message your Friends or other users on Doin. This may
      increase attendance at events, allow you to connect with more Friends, and share fun memories after the events.
    - We did not implement this feature because we didnâ€™t have sufficient time to complete it.
    - Including messaging functionality could improve user retention and create a more connected social experience.
3. **Cloud storage for images**
    - Another possible change is storing images in a cloud system, like **AWS**, instead of in the relational database.
      This would have reduced the size of the database and improved scalability and performance for handling images.
    - We did not implement this feature because of the monetary resources required for it.
4. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - A final feature we would have liked to add is Two-Factor Authentication. This would greatly improve
       security on our app, enhancing protection for sensitive data and building user trust.
   - Because of the additional resources it requires, we decided to focus on the other aspects of the program.

### MySQL Setup Instructions

**Database Credentials:** Our database is named `doin_db` with a user of `doinapp`, whose password is `pass`. In order 
to change any of these credentials, make sure that you change it when following the code below and change it 
in the `doin-backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`
```properties
# database name ("doin_db") and port to listen to (3306)
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/doin_db
# user's username ("doinapp")
spring.datasource.username=doinapp
# user's password ("pass")
spring.datasource.password=pass
```

#### 0. Installing MySQL

We used **Server version: 8.0.39 MySQL Community Server**, but it should work with any later version.

For instructions on how to install MySQL and set up a root user, we found 
<a href="https://www.mysqltutorial.org/getting-started-with-mysql/install-mysql/"> MySqlTutorial </a> 
and <a href="https://www.w3schools.in/mysql/setup/"> W3Schools </a> very useful.

Follow these steps to start MySQL, create a database, and configure a new user for the application:

#### 1. **Start MySQL**
- **On Windows**:
    1. Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell.
    2. Start the MySQL server:
       ```bash
       net start mysql
       ```
    3. Log in to MySQL:
       ```bash
       mysql -u root -p
       ```
       Enter the root password when prompted.

- **On macOS/Linux**:
    1. Open a terminal.
    2. Start the MySQL server (if not already running):
       ```bash
       sudo service mysql start
       ```
    3. Log in to MySQL:
       ```bash
       mysql -u root -p
       ```
       Enter the root password when prompted.

#### 2. **Create the Application Database**
1. After logging into the MySQL shell, create a new database:
   ```MySQL
   CREATE DATABASE doin_db;
   ```
2. Verify the database was created:
   ```MySQL
   SHOW DATABASES;
   ```

#### 3. **Create a New MySQL User**
1. Create a new user with a username and password for the application:
   ```MySQL
   CREATE USER 'doinapp'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass';
   ```
2. Grant privileges to the new user for the `doin_db` database:
   ```sql
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON doin_db.* TO 'doinapp'@'localhost';
   ```
3. Apply the changes:
   ```MySQL
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

#### 4. **Exit MySQL**
- Exit the MySQL shell:
  ```MySQL
  EXIT;
  ```

#### 5. **Test the New User**
- Log in to MySQL using the new user credentials:
  ```bash
  mysql -u doinapp -p
  ```
  Enter the password (`pass`) when prompted.
- Switch to the `doin_db` database to ensure everything is set up correctly:
  ```MySQL
  USE doin_db;
  ```

#### 6. Inserting Security Questions

We used 3 different security questions to give the user a way to reset their password and verify their identity. Their
values are "pet", "school", and "city". These 3 values need to be added to the database and the frontend's register 
HTML page (`doin-frontend\src\app\register\register.component.html`). The values must match exactly on both the 
HTML and in the database in order for the app to function correctly.

**IMPORTANT:** Before inserting data into the tables, the tables must first be created.

There are 2 ways to create the table:

- **Option 1: Automatically generate the tables with Gradle**  
  Start Gradle (See [Starting the Backend](#starting-the-backend)). All tables (including the `security_questions` and `event_types` 
  table) will be automatically generated. The questions will *not* be automatically added into the database.
  - The easiest way to insert the data is using following **Insert the 3 Security Questions and Event Types** below. 

- **Option 2: Manually create the SecurityQuestion and EventType table and insert the data**  
  If you choose to create the table manually, use the following SQL commands:

    1. **Create the `security_questions` table(optional):**

        ```mysql
        CREATE TABLE security_questions (
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            question VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
        );
        ```

    2. **Insert the 3 Security Questions(required):**

        ```mysql
        INSERT INTO security_questions (question) VALUES ('pet');
        INSERT INTO security_questions (question) VALUES ('school');
        INSERT INTO security_questions (question) VALUES ('city');
        ```
    3. **Create the `event_types` table(optional):**

        ```mysql
        CREATE TABLE event_types (
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
        );
        ```

    4. **Insert the 3 Event Types(required):**

        ```mysql
        INSERT INTO event_types (name) VALUES ('lunch');
        INSERT INTO event_types (name) VALUES ('party');
        INSERT INTO event_types (name) VALUES ('meeting');
        ```
        

  To run the SQL commands:

    1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
    2. Log into MySQL:
       ```bash
       mysql -u doinapp -p
       ```
       Enter your password when prompted (`pass`).
    3. Select the `doin_db` database:
       ```mysql
       USE doin_db;
       ```
    4. Run the SQL commands one by one. You can copy-paste the commands into the terminal.

After executing these commands, the `security_questions` table will have the three required questions, and 
the application will work correctly for user registration and password recovery.

To change or add security questions: edit the insert statements and edit the HTML page.

**Reminder**: After setting up MySQL, make sure that the database credentials in `doin-backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` match those you set up in MySQL.


### Summary of Commands
Use this quick reference for setup:
```bash
# Start MySQL
mysql -u root -p

# Inside the MySQL shell
CREATE DATABASE doin_db;
CREATE USER 'doinapp'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON doin_db.* TO 'doinapp'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;

# Test the new user
mysql -u doinapp -p
USE doin_db;

# OPTIONAL: to create the security_question table
CREATE TABLE security_questions (
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            question VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
  
# Inserting the data
INSERT INTO security_questions (question) VALUES ('pet');
INSERT INTO security_questions (question) VALUES ('school');
INSERT INTO security_questions (question) VALUES ('city');
````

### Angular Setup

#### 1. Install Node.js and npm
Angular requires **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) for dependency management and running the Angular CLI.

- **Download Node.js and npm** from the official website: <a href="https://nodejs.org/"> Node.js </a>
- After installation, verify that both Node.js and npm are installed correctly by running:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```
    - If you encounter issues with Node.js or npm installation, check the official Node.js installation guide at 
    the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/"> Node.js Website</a>.

  
#### 2. Install Angular CLI
Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) helps you create and manage Angular applications. To install Angular CLI
globally on your machine, run:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

#### 3. Verify Angular CLI Installation
To check if Angular CLI was installed correctly, run:
```bash
ng version
```

#### 4. Install Project Dependencies
Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the frontend directory (`doin-frontend`) and 
install the necessary npm dependencies:
```bash
cd doin-frontend
npm install
```
- This installs all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file 
(located in the `doin-frontend` directory).

## Usage
### Starting the backend
1. Open a command line
2. Change directories to doin-backend. EX: `cd doin-backend`
3. Start Gradle <BR>
    ```bash
   # If you don't have Gradle installed globally, use the wrapper (gradlew)
   ./gradle bootRun # For MacOS and Linux
   gradlew bootRun  # For windows (CMD)
    ```
   - A functioning output will look similar to:
       ```bash
       <==========---> 80% EXECUTING [10s]`. In order for `bootRun
       ```
     - To be functioning correctly, it should be ongoing and running uninterrupted.
- If gradle outputs something similar to: `"BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 14s 4 actionable tasks: 3 executed, 1 up-to-date `
  make sure that the MySQL database is running. 
  - See [above](#1-start-mysql) for how to start MySQL and check if the `doin_db` is running.
- If gradle builds unsuccessfully (likely something wrong with the backend's code), you will see an output similar to 
  `BUILD FAILED in 3s`

### Starting the frontend
1. Navigate to the doin-frontend. EX: `cd doin-frontend`
2. Start Angular
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
- A successful build will look like 
```bash
  Application bundle generation complete. [3.352 seconds] Watch mode enabled.
  Watching for file changes...
  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:4200/
```
### In Browser
**Important:** Both the backend and frontend must be running for the application to function properly.

In your favorite browser, open http://localhost:4200 to see Doin! From there, enjoy the app!
- If the app doesn't load, make sure the frontend and backend are be running!
